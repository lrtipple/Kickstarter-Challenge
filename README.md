# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project used my knowledge of pivot tables and graphs in Excel to visualize campaign outcomes, based on launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges
I used a pivot table to view theater outcomes by launch date and created a line chart that points out the number of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes by month and year. 
I used formulas and links to the data in order to visulaize the number of plays that were successful, failed, or canceled within monetary goal ranges. I faced challenges with the countifs formula and ensuring I had appropriate equal signs to pull in the correct number of campaigns per each range. This took some additional data validation.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May and June have the highest number of successful launched theather campains. In general, theater campaigns are an average of 66% successful. The lowest month for successful campaigns is December, and still 49% are successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The lower the monetary goal for plays, the higher the success rate. Plays with a goal less than $5,000.00 are 74% successful. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Out of 1,369 theater campaigns, 839 were successful and 493 failed. 

The most sucessful month to launch a kickstart campaign for theater catergories is in May.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Out of 1,047 play campaigns, 694 were successgul. 529 of the successful campaigns had a monetary goal under $5,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations of this dataset are most individual countries have a very low number of campaigns, so it would be better to target a specific country when performing analyses. Also, most of the campagins collected in the dataset are from 2014-2016, making the data 6 years old. The data also lacks information regarding the interest type of sub-category; i.e. comedy, tragedy, historical, which could also impact the outcome of the campaigns.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create graphs that target on the name and blurb for the most successful campaigns so Louise could get an idea of interest types by success.
